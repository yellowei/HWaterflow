This is a flow layout for UICollectionView.

You can set a array to set a collection view`s layout, this array like that "@[@(3),@(4),@(1)]", these numbers can reflecting structure for your collection view. 

To set layout, you can set two properties:
				<a href="@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray * columnForSections;"></a>
o;
				.<a href="@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray * rowForSections;"></a>

In addiont, you can control the Supplementary Views` heights at the same time.
